### Problem Statement
With the number of tasks increasing day-by-day, it is becoming difficult for individuals to manage so many tasks considering the varying amount of time available and required to complete them. It requires continuous and active effort to create weekly schedules. This leads to wastage of valuable time, and poor planning might lead to excessive workloads. In such situations, an application that makes a schedule (time-table) for the individuals taking into account their pending tasks, deadlines will be a great asset for students.
